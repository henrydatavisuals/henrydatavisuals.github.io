          I've previously worked at Labatt Breweries of Canada (AB InBev) & Georgian Bay Spirit Co. (Small Canadian Startup) where 
          I focused on data analysis and operations. As a result I have anticipated future outcomes, led data-based decision making, 
          and drawn measurable insights.

          A big part of data analysis is making the right information look good & easily accessible.
          With my expertise in translating complex data into actionable visuals we can uncover opportunities, identify areas of risk, and most importantly help you ask the right questions.
          This will all be done on Excel or PowerBI so it'll be cost effective and compatible with any existing work environment.
